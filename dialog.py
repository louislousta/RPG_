Hello mate, what can I get you? ...Wait, I recognise you! You were in here last night
with those two shifty looking characters. You certainly aren't looking too well now. 
Where did you three go and cause trouble when you left then? 

....

You can't remember? Happens to the best of us. What happened? Did you hit your head or 
something?

....

I can guess. They knocked you out, took all your money and belongings and left you for 
dead in my stable. You need to take a bit more care with the company you keep. Anyway 
if you're looking to earn a bit of coin, I've got a rat infestation in my cellar you 
can help me with. It's just behind the bar to the east. If you need a weapon, there's a 
sword out in the courtyard. I use it for chopping firewood, so it's no Excalibur, but 
it'll do for killing rats. Come and see me when you're done.
