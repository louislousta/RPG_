# RPG

Plan for a text based RPG :
The goal for this project is to showcase my creativity and coding skills while hopefully having fun at the same time.
Things to include:
* character - a class that allows for a name, level and stats
* rooms - A room class with flavor text, types like forest, road, dungeon etc
* map - a 2d grid of rooms, with the ability to move between them
* inventory - a list of things your character owns 
* enemies - random monsters to cause issues for character
* combat - probably dice based, useing weapons or magic
* storyline - classic heros journey i guess
* leveling - gain xp from fighting monsters and completing quests
